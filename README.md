## About Laravel-livewire-crud

Here I created a simple laravel livewire crud example which contain simple text and Image as well for development,So the question is how to Install this in your local system the solution is that simple 

- at First you have to clone this repository in your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/NihirRootways/laravel-livewire.git
```

- Enter this project :

```
cd laravel-livewire
```

- first rename .env.example file to .env

```
cp .env.example .env
```

- create database and that name put in .env file ```DB_DATABASE``` and check that all database credential is correct or not?

- Import the livewire_demo.sql in that database

- Generate the APP_KEY:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

- Update the composer dependency:

```
composer Update
```

- Then the finely start the server:

```
php artisan serve
```
